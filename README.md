This is an attempt to build a lisp interpreter in F#

I will try to make it compatible with the interpreter I already built when I was following the instructions of the http://buildyourownlisp.com website. 

The other interpreter can be found here: https://github.com/ThanosPapathanasiou/lispy 

To build the project you need to open a terminal in the base directory and run the following command.

In linux

``` bash
make build
```
